# TrickOrTreater-Toothbrush
Same as TrickOrTreater Repo, but there is an added class and functions changed in order to have everything work the way we intend.
This assignment was also to see how many times the destructor runs so that we are aware of it when we code in the future.

Note: As last assignment stated (TrickOrTreater Repo), some of the code was given to us from the professor to complete the assignment. The full reasoning is because it was nearing the end of the semester, so for time reasons.
